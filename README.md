I customize my Hugo site by directly editing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. 
I use Hugo as the static site generator for managing and building the site. 
I also incorporate FontAwesome for icons, but aside from that, I donâ€™t rely on front-end libraries like Bootstrap or jQuery. 
I prefer full control over the design and functionality.
